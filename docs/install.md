# Install
This section will demonstrate how Hasty Paste can be installed and configured.

## Important Notes
Please read these notes before continuing.

- Running on a filesystem that is case-insensitive is **not** supported
- Running multiple instances is supported, you could even use rsync to sync between multiple file systems.
- The paste root directory must have read/write permissions for the user running the app
- Access to add and read pastes is public, use a reverse proxy to add authentication
- A HTTPS connection at endpoint is required for the "Copy Share Link" button
- Use HTTPS otherwise paste links are exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks
- If you have a high amount of clients, use Redis caching and set `WORKERS` to match the physical cpu cores
- If using S3 the bucket should already be created with read/write access
- S3 currently has been tested with [MinIO](https://min.io/) (can self-host)
- Currently supported Python version is `3.12`

## Configuration
All configs shown here should be given as environment variables.

### Redis Uri
The `CACHE__REDIS_URI` can only accept certain formats, these are shown below:

- `redis://[[username]:[password]]@localhost:6379/0`
- `rediss://[[username]:[password]]@localhost:6379/0`
- `unix://[[username]:[password]]@/path/to/socket.sock?db=0`

e.g

```
CACHE__REDIS_URI="redis://localhost:6379"
```

### Cache
Hasty Paste supports tired caching. For example both the internal cache and Redis cache can be used. The priority of the cache types are shown below:

```
Internal -> Redis -> Miss
```

If you are using multiple workers (set via `WORKERS`), each worker does **not** share memory. This means when using the internal cache, each cached item will be duplicated across workers (increasing memory usage). If this is the case you may want to use Redis and select a smaller internal cache size.

## With Docker (Recommended)
This will assume you have both Docker and Docker Compose installed. You can use any other container software, however it is not documented here. To increase security the container will run as the `nobody` user instead of `root`.

1. Create directory for app
2. Create file called `docker-compose.yml` inside folder
3. Copy example compose file shown below
4. Run `docker compose up -d` inside folder
5. Hasty Paste is now running

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  paste-bin:
    container_name: paste-bin
    image: ghcr.io/enchant97/hasty-paste:1
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - data:/app/data
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    environment:
      - "TIME_ZONE=Europe/London"

volumes:
  data:
```

### With Redis

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  redis:
    container_name: redis
    image: redis:alpine
    restart: unless-stopped

  paste-bin:
    container_name: paste-bin
    image: ghcr.io/enchant97/hasty-paste:1
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - data:/app/data
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    environment:
      - "TIME_ZONE=Europe/London"
      - "CACHE__REDIS_URI=redis://redis:6379"
    depends_on:
      - redis

volumes:
  data:
```

### With S3

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  paste-bin:
    container_name: paste-bin
    image: ghcr.io/enchant97/hasty-paste:1
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    environment:
      - "TIME_ZONE=Europe/London"
      - "STORAGE__TYPE=S3"
      - "STORAGE__S3__BUCKET_NAME="hasty-paste"
      - "STORAGE__S3__ACCESS_KEY_ID=< key id here >"
      - "STORAGE__S3__SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=< secret access key here >"

```

## Without Docker
This will assume the supported Python version is installed and accessible.

```
git clone https://github.com/enchant97/hasty-paste

cd hasty-paste

make py-venv

source .venv/bin/activate

make py-install

echo "STORAGE__DISK__PASTE_ROOT=data/
TIME_ZONE=Europe/London
" > .env

hypercorn 'asgi:paste_bin.main:create_app()' --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 1
```

This is what the final file structure should look like:

```
hasty-paste/
  .venv/
  .env
```

If you wish to configure Hypercorn the documentation can be found [here](https://hypercorn.readthedocs.io/), you could for example configure https or different bind methods.

To upgrade in the future use the following commands:

```
source .venv/bin/activate

git pull

make py-install
```
